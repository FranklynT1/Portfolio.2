This Portfoliio was vreated to document my current work in this class. Over the couse i hope to expand my knolege and show case it here

## Navbar/Main banner section

![Banner](/assets/images/banner.png)

The navbar brings you down to various parts of the portfolio page. The background image is connected to the about-me section, which lets you scroll down while keeping the image looking nice through out (this was done by keeping the background attachment fixed for the specific class). This idea was given to me by my class mate.

##  Projects section

![Projects](/assets/images/projects.png)

The projects portion of the page shows previews of the other websites that have been created through the course so far, and takes the user to each one when they click on it. The color filter stops being greyed out on each one once you hover over it (done using greyscale filter with hover attribute on css classes). Each project also grows a little bit when hovered over as well. An idea also given to me by my class mate.

## Contact Me section and footer
